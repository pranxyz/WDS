  <h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>
  <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
  <p>Because dive is special, it has it's own id, "content"
  <br>This allows use to differentiate it from  other divs and give it a white background.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span><span class="fancy"> and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span>
  <br>because they belong to two classes "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, <span class="blue"><span class="fancy"> this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></span></p>
</div> 
<div>
<p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
