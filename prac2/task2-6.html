<div id="content">
  <h1>Check out my borders</h1>
  <p>We've modified the content div to have 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.</p>
  <p>Other elements can have broders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.</p>
  <hr> 
  <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;
  <br> all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.</p>
  <p>Alternately, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span> 
  <br> That prevents it from messing with the line height.</p>  
  
</div> 

<p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>

<div class="div1"> 
  This div has a red border</div>
<div class="div2">
  This div has a blue border</div>  

<p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>

<div class="div3">
  This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>

<div class="div4">
  This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>
